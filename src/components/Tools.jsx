              Even if youâ€™re freelancing, but especially if youâ€™re part of a
              team, you need a reliable version control system to keep track of

              Git is a decentralized version control system which allows
              everyone on your team to work with the same files in the same
              project simultaneously without worrying that you might be
              overwriting someoneâ€™s work.{" "}

              is, well, awesome for the vast array of icons it offers (1,000+
              for free and 7,000+ on the paid plan). Similarly,{" "}

              Speaking of looking good, front-end frameworks are another
              must-have for front-end developers! Front-end frameworks are
              packages of files for styling and laying out your websites.
              Frameworks are made up of ready-made navigation menus, buttons,
              forms, typography, and other assets so you donâ€™t have to write
              all that code yourself.

            <p>
              CSS is a style sheet language used for styling your web pages. And
              you can make creating a beautiful site with CSS even simpler with
              preprocessors. A CSS preprocessor is basically a language that,
              after itâ€™s processed, gives you even more CSS features. A
              preprocessor also lets you write code thatâ€™s easier to read,
              maintain, and shareâ€”all vital for working on a developer team or
              even on your own.

            <p>
              JavaScript libraries are collections of code that make your sites
              interactive, provide better browser support, and add effects like
              animations, blog post tags, and auto-completing form fields.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like libraries, JavaScript frameworks can simplify your front-end
              development workflow. But frameworks differ from libraries in that
              frameworks provide the overall structure (or framework) for sites
              using JavaScript, while libraries focus on one or more specific
              aspects of a site.

            <p>
              s you build your sites, often youâ€™ll want to make modifications
              and test how they look â€œliveâ€ in your browser before committing
              the changes. You can do all this with developer tools, often
              called dev tools for short.

            <p>
              Coding environments are sites that allow you to write code in an
              online editor and see the results immediately right next to your
              code. These platforms are a fast and useful way for developers to
              experiment and learn from other developers in the same
              environment. CodePen is the most diverse online coding environment
              in that you can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and even try out
              those libraries and frameworks you were just reading about.
